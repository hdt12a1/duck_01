# Introduction to literals and operators

**Literals**

- A literals (also known as a literal constant) is a fixed value that has been
inserted directly into the source code.
- Literals and variables both have a value. 


### Expression

* An expression is a combination of literals, variables, operators, and function calls that calculates a single value.
* The process of excuting an expression is called **evaluation**, and the single value produced is called the result of the expression.
